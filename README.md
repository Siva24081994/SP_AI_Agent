# AI Agent for Stock Prediction and Investment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI agent capable of predicting stock prices and performing investment analysis. The AI uses statistical models and data analysis techniques to forecast future prices and assess market trends, helping users make informed investment decisions.

### Key Features:
- Stock price prediction using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)
- Mutual fund NAV simulation and analysis
- Visualization of historical trends and predicted values
- Performance evaluation of prediction models
- Data handling for financial datasets

## How It Works
1. The AI model takes historical stock prices as input.
2. It predicts future prices using stochastic processes like GBM.
3. The results are visualized to showcase trends and potential future movements.
4. Mutual fund performance is simulated and analyzed.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical calculations
- Matplotlib for visualizations
- Scikit-learn for data processing

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siva24081994/SP_AI_Agent.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SP_AI_Agent
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the notebook file in Jupyter.
2. Run the cells sequentially to perform predictions and visualize results.
3. Adjust model parameters as needed to experiment with different scenarios.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrating adaptive models to handle market volatility
- Improving explainability using SHAP or LIME
- Enhancing compliance by adding disclaimers and risk assessments
